Setting
These character conversions are applied to both text being searched, and to the search terms themselves. After updating character conversion settings, all index files must be rebuilt. Otherwise, many searches will fail to bring up results.
Next, all characters are converted to a corresponding value from the four right columns below, based on the two character conversion settings above. A blank space in the right hand columns means that the character will be ignored.
First, all HTML entities are converted to their single-byte character equivalent.
These settings control how accented and upper-case characters are handled.

Including only files with these extensions: $s1 (<a href="$s2">Edit</a>)
Perl version is $s1 ($s2).<br />Web server operating system is $s3.<br />Web server software is $s4.
File-Fed Realms
Allow binary files (Word docs, MP3 files, etc.) in Local Realms. The contents of the file are not indexed - only the filename itself.
Follow symbolic links while building file lists for Local Realms.
The number of days before the crawler will become interested in re-visiting a website in a Remote Realm. Note that the crawler does not start re-indexing on it's own. Rather, when you use the "Revisit Old Pages" command, the crawler will use this value to decide whether a page is "Old" or not.
Controls whether to extract links to other sites when parsing an HTML page. For example, web page http://foo.com/foo.htm has links to http://foo.com/bar.htm, and to http://x.com. If Follow Offsite Links = 1, then both links are extracted; otherwise, only the first is extracted. Note that this only governs link extraction - you can still enter any starting URL you wish.
Controls whether to extract links that have query strings, such as "http://foo.com/?name=value". Note that this only governs link extraction - you can still enter any starting URL you wish.
A space-separated list of file extensions. Will not extract links to files with these extensions when parsing an HTML page. By ignoring links that probably won't lead to text-based files, the overall efficiency of the crawler is increased. Note that this only governs link extraction - you can still enter any starting URL you wish.
Maximum number of web pages that the crawler will request during a single admin action. Setting this too high will increase the likelihood of a server timeout during a crawl session; setting it too low will be less efficient for crawling large numbers of pages. 10 - 40 is a good range. See the "Timeout" setting for another way to manage this.
Maximum number of HTTP and HTML redirects to be followed while trying to request a single page.
Minimum ratio of spaces to total file content. Typical text documents have a whitespace ratio of 1:6 (or 0.16). Binary data has the much lower whitespace ratio of 0.004. The whitespace ratio is used as a test to see whether a file has text content (desired) or binary content (bad), in instances where traditional content-type or -T tests fail.
Controls whether the web crawler will respect the robots exclusion protocol. Setting this to 1 will cause robots.txt and Robots Meta tags to be ignored.
500-anchor
The default value to use in the search form. "0" means "Match Any Term". "1" means "Match All Terms". "2" means "Match as Phrase".  (Visitors can still manually choose whichever they want right before they search.)
When deleting a realm, the associated index files may be deleted also. To delete index files with the realm, set this setting to 1 (checked). Otherwise, set it to 0 (unchecked).
Space-separated list of file extensions to be indexed during the creation of Local Realms.
When a page description is in all caps, the parse_html_ex function will convert it to lowercase.
When a page title is in all caps, the parse_html_ex function will convert it to lowercase.
Sometimes visitors type in search terms like "http://www.hotmail.com/" or "www.hotmail.com". They expect to just be taken to the appropriate website, rather than have a search performed on this term. FDSE can handle this three ways: 1. treat the URL as a normal search term; 2. treat the URL as a term, but at the top of the results list, say "Click here to visit URL"; 3. redirect the visitor to the URL immediately.
Number of search results to show per page.
Space-separated list of words that will be stripped from HTML before being stored in the index files. Keep this list full of common words to keep the index file size manageable.
Controls whether ALT and TITLE attributes - commonly found in IMG tags - will be stored in the index file.
Controls whether the search index will include information about all the links in a web page. This feature allows end users to search for "link:xav.com" and find all web pages that link to "xav.com". However, this adds 5-15% to the size of the index file for a rarely-used feature, and so this is disabled by default.
Maximum bytes read from a file to generate a description (when no Meta description tag is present).
Maximum bytes read from the Meta description tag.
Maximum bytes read from the underlying file, or from a network web page, before passing it to the HTML parsing function. By keeping this at a reasonable value, the crawler won't choke when it encounters huge files (say, 20 MB). This limit is imposed at a very low level, when the file is first read from disk or read over the network.
Maximum bytes allowed from the keywords Meta tag.
Maximum bytes of normal text saved to the index file. For those who need a very lean and mean search engine that indexes only titles, descriptions, and keywords, set this value to 0. Note that this is a very high-level limit, imposed after parsing HTML. Compare with the low-level "Max Characters: File" property.
Maximum bytes allowed for the title.
Will not extract links to URL's longer than this when parsing an HTML page. While other "Max Characters" settings will just truncate strings (like a web page title can be stripped to the first 96 bytes), URL that exceed the maximum length will be ignored altogether. Note that this only governs link extraction - you can still enter any starting URL you wish.
This is the maximum size, in bytes, allowed for an index file. After it reaches this size, no additional web pages can be indexed. This feature is mainly used in conjunction with the AllowAnonAdd setting, where end users can be adding their URL's to your search engine on their own. Setting the max size to 0 means there is no maximum size.
The minimum allowed size for indexed web pages, in bytes.
For purposes of weighting search results, a word in the description will count this many times more than a word in the file body. Setting this to zero will cause this field to not be weighted any more heavily than the rest of the document, but will speed up the search engine.

The followings URLs were found while indexing realm <b>$s1</b> but there were errors during retrieval.  (The reason for each error is not recorded.)
Allow web pages to control the URL used to reference them, using the proprietary "fdse-index-as" META tag. See help file for more information.
This is an absolute or relative URL that is inserted before the true URL in the search results listing. Typically it is the path to a CGI script that transparently logs where visitors are going before sending them to their destination.
Controls whether the search engine uses a database or the filesystem for searches and administrative functions.
In the search results list, will show an example of the search term being used in the document. This is very helpful for putting the search result in context. Enabling this option causes searches to take a little longer. Also, this feature is only really useful if you delete or shrink the "Ignore Words" setting, and then rebuild your index files. Otherwise the examples aren't readable.
When the "Show Examples: Enable" setting is on, this controls how many examples are shown to the end user. The search engine is optimized for the default setting, 1. Increasing to higher values causes searches to take longer.
Set to: 1 to sort by relevance; 2, reverse relevance; 3, last modified time, with newest entries first; 4, reverse last modified time; 5, last indexed time, with newest entries first; 6, reverse last indexed time.
When enabled, the search results which have an otherwise equal relevance will be randomly ordered.
Number of seconds of idle time before the FDSE admin script restarts itself during long operations, like an index rebuild. A longer idle interval will reduce the load on the server.
The number of seconds before a CGI script will time out on this server. Used to throttle the local file indexing and crawler processes, to prevent a server timeout.
Disable the algorithm that guards against infinite loops when following symbolic links.
When checked, all network socket operations use the standard, buffered input/output routines. When unchecked, network socket operations will bypass standard I/O. This setting exists to allow you to work around a bug on some Windows NT 4.0 systems which require bypassing standard IO.
The Perl regular expression to use in place of "*" in user queries. The default, "\S{0,4}", will match zero to 4 non-whitespace characters. To match any character, including whitespace, use ".{0,4}". To match 0 to 100 characters, use ".{0,100}". Limiting the range of matches to a low number like 4 will improve performance.
Save information about visitor searches to a log, for analysis later.
When enabled, documents modified in the last two days will have their base relevance multiplied by 4; documents modified in the last 4 days have their relevance multiplied by 3; and documents modified in the last 8 days have their relevance multiplied by 2. Use this feature when searching time-sensitive material, like news articles.

Number of seconds before timing out a send or receive. This feature is implemented only on platforms which support IO::Select and alarm().
Provides the user with some control over the interface language.<br />Values: 0 -&gt; use FDSE default interface language; 1 -&gt; detect browser language, or failover to FDSE default interface language, 2 -&gt; detect user-selected language, or use default; 3 -&gt; detect user-selected language, then browser language, then default.

A string that will appear in the search form's "Terms" input when the form is first displayed for the user.
Displays options for advanced realms types, realm settings, and indexing options.
Controls whether functionality that depends on DBM files will be exposed.  DBM files works on most platforms, but not all.  If they do not work on this platform, uncheck this setting to avoid errors.
Controls whether functionality that depends on network sockets will be exposed.  Sockets are supported on most web hosting platforms, but not all.  If they do not work on this platform, uncheck this setting to avoid errors.
When substring matching is enabled, a search for "eat" will matching "beating" and "neat". Otherwise, "eat" will only match the whole word "eat".
The user-agent tag of the crawler; used as an identification string during HTTP requests and robots.txt parsing.
